NumPy, short for Numerical Python, is one of the most important foundational pack‐
ages for numerical computing in Python. Most computational packages providing
scientific functionality use NumPy’s array objects as the lingua franca for data
exchange.
Here are some of the things you’ll find in NumPy:
ndarray, an efficient multidimensional array providing fast array-oriented arith‐
metic operations and flexible broadcasting capabilities.
Mathematical functions for fast operations on entire arrays of data without hav‐
ing to write loops.
Tools for reading/writing array data to disk and working with memory-mapped
files.
Linear algebra, random number generation, and Fourier transform capabilities.
A C API for connecting NumPy with libraries written in C, C++, or FORTRAN.
Because NumPy provides an easy-to-use C API, it is straightforward to pass data to
external libraries written in a low-level language and also for external libraries to
return data to Python as NumPy arrays. This feature has made Python a language of
choice for wrapping legacy C/C++/Fortran codebases and giving them a dynamic and
easy-to-use interface.
